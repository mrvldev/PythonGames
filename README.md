In this section i start to learn games with python.
I downloaded the Pygame Ce software and i am curious how the progress will be.

I will first start with an simple Space Shooter Game and follow along a video on Youtube "Master Python by making 5 games [the new ultimate introduction to pygame]" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OMghdHP-zs

I will learn the function of game loops, gamer inputs and enemy crowd control.

I hope you will enjoy to play it.
